# Ikiguide üåü

Ikiguide is a software application designed to help users explore potential paths in life based on their input, inspired by the Japanese concept of Ikigai. Ikigai is a Japanese term that means "a reason for being" and is often used to describe the things that make one's life worthwhile.

## What is Ikigai? ü§î

Ikigai is a concept that encourages individuals to find their purpose in life by exploring the intersection of four key questions:
1. **What do you love?** ‚ù§Ô∏è
2. **What are you good at?** üõ†Ô∏è
3. **What does the world need?** üåç
4. **What can you be paid for?** üí∞

By answering these questions, Ikiguide helps users identify potential paths that align with their passions, skills, societal needs, and financial opportunities.

## Project Structure

- **ikiguide-backend**: Contains the server-side code, responsible for handling API requests and managing data.
- **ikiguide-frontend**: Includes the client-side code, built with React, to provide an interactive user interface.
